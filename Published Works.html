<p align="left">Background of the Pseudonym: </p>
<p align="left">The pseudonym "Augustine de Valle" is used by Brianne Gabrielle C. Rodriguez, a Literary Writer.
The origin of the name "Augustine" came from the song "August" by Taylor Swift as the character in the song is named Augustine. 
Brianne was fond of the name "Augustine" therefore she took inspiration by using the name as a writer. 
The pseudonym "de Valle" came from the writer's favorite flowers which are Lilies of the Valley. 
The flower symbolizes purity of the heart and soul. This symbolic meaning sparked the literary writer because she could relate with its meaningâ€”she writes with purity and sincerity, pouring her heart and soul in her writings. </p>
